Operating Systems Projects and Code
-----------------------------------

This is a collection of class assignments developed for CSE 30341,
the undergraduate operating systems class at Notre Dame, first by
Prof. Douglas Thain, and then developed further by Prof. Christian Poellabauer.

In order of difficulty, they are:

- warmup - Use Unix system calls to copy files recursively.
- shell - Use Unix system calls to build a command line shell.
- mandelbrot - Accelerate a graphical program using processes and threads.
- webserver - Evaluate threads, events, and processes for implementing a web server.
- disk-scheduler - Construct a concurrent disk scheduler that handles multiple threads.
- virtual-memory - Construct a user-level demand-paged memory and evaluate its performance.
