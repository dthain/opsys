<h1>Project 3 Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<dir>
<li> <b>ffmpeg and ffplay don't seem to work in the Fitzpatrick lab.</b>
<p>
Oops, my mistake.  You can find those programs in <tt>/afs/nd.edu/user37/ccl/software/external/ffmpeg/bin</tt>.
<p>
<li> <b>How can I construct a string that contains a floating point number to use as the <tt>-s</tt> argument?</b>
<p>
Use the very handy function <tt>sprintf</tt>, which is like <tt>printf</tt>
but puts the result in a string.  Then, re-use what you learned in the previous project to split the string into words.  For example, something like this:
<pre>
char command[256];
char *words[100];

sprintf(command,"./mandel -x -.5 -y .5 -m 2000 -s %lf",zoom);

word[0] = strtok(command," ");

while(1) {
   ...
}
</pre>
<p>
<li> <b>When I <tt>ssh</tt> into the Fitzpatrick machines, I keep getting kicked off!  What should I do?</b>
<p>
As we discussed in class, the policy in the Fitzpatrick lab is to give
first priority to people sitting at the workstations.  In order to
get correct performance results on your code, you will need to actually
go to the lab and sit down at a machine.
<p>
<li> <b>What's the grade breakdown for this assignment?</b>
<p>
Oops, I left that out the first time.
I have added the grade breakdown to the end of the assignment.
<p>
<li> <b>I get linking errors when I try to use <tt>exp</tt> and <tt>log</tt>!</b>
<p>
These are in the math library, so you need to include <tt>math.h</tt> and add the argument <tt>-lm</tt> to your link line.
