<h1>Project II Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<ol>
<li> <b>Some of the system calls like <tt>strsignal</tt> are behaving very strangely!</b>
<p>
Make sure that you are compiling with all warnings enabled with the <b>-Wall</b> flag like this:
<pre>
gcc -Wall -g myshell.c -o myshell
</pre>

Most warnings should really be errors, and unfortunately, they are worded in a way that is technically precise, but often confusing.  Here are some common kinds of warnings:
<pre>
myshell.c:70: warning: implicit declaration of function `strsignal'
</pre>
The warning "implicit declaration" technically means that you are trying to use a function 
that was never declared to the compiler, so it doesn't know how to invoke it.
Practically speaking, it means that you are missing the proper <tt>#include</tt> directive.
Look up the man page for the given function to figure out what <tt>#include</tt> to add to your program.
<p>
<pre>
myshell.c:35: warning: format argument is not a pointer (arg 3)
</pre>
This argument means that you have a problem with a <tt>printf</tt> statement.
The "format argument" is the string that contains the percent codes.
Make sure that each of your percent codes match up with the rest of the arguments.
<p>
<pre>
myshell.c:4: warning: control reaches end of non-void function
</pre>
This warning tells you that your function is lacking a <tt>return</tt> statement.  This is bad, because the function might return any arbitrary value, which is probably not what you want.  If you deliberately want a function that returns no value, declare it as a <tt>void</tt> function.
<p>
<li><b>Suppose that I start one process with the <tt>start</tt> command, and then another with the <tt>run</tt> command.  Which process should <tt>run</tt> wait for?</b>
<p>
The <b>run</b> command should only wait for the particular process that was just started.  The <tt>wait</tt> system call will not help you here, because it waits for any finished process.  Instead, use the <tt>waitpid</tt> system call, which can wait for one particular process.
<p>
<li> <b>It seems like a program named "start" gets run instead of my program.</b>
<p>
 You will need to do a little translation before passing the arguments to execvp.
After using strtok to split up the line, you will have something like this:
<pre>
words[0] = "start"
words[1] = "emacs"
words[2] = "doc.txt"
words[3] = 0;
</pre>
Now, inside of your shell, you will examine words[0] to figure out
whether to do a start, a wait, or something else.  If you are doing a
start, then, you need to assemble an array that looks like this:
<pre>
args[0] = "emacs"
args[1] = "doc.txt"
args[2] = 0;
</pre>
Then, you can simply call execvp(args[0],args);
<p>
</ol>
